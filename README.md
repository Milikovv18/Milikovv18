# About Me

Hi, I'm Mikhail, an Android Developer since the beginning of 2022. My GitHub features older pet projects, as my professional work has been on closed-source B2B solutions. Here's a quick summary of my skills and experience:
- Developed a comprehensive Mobile Device Management (MDM) system for corporate use, integrating various device modules such as Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Microphone. The system utilized the WebDAV protocol for data exchange and was optimized to handle challenges posed by Android process management tools like Phantom (introduced in Android 12). The solution ensured compatibility across a wide range of devices, from standard Google Pixel models to highly restricted Xiaomi devices.
- Gained extensive experience with Android Accessibility Services, primarily using them for automation tasks, such as modifying complex device settings that are difficult for average users to access. Currently, I am developing an LLM-driven automation app, which will also serve as my masterâ€™s thesis. Project Link.
- Customized app sandboxes for specific project requirements using an open-source virtualization engine. This work included enabling pseudo-root access for applications and allowing multiple apps to run within the same address space.
- Designed and implemented the user interface for a messenger application using Jetpack Compose, with the backend powered by Telegram and a custom front-end interface.
- Built accessibility overlays using Jetpack Compose in conjunction with LifecycleService. This required manual initialization of Jetpack Compose to ensure full feature functionality, such as automatic recomposition.
- Implemented dynamic loading and execution of DEX files at runtime, enhancing application flexibility.
- Recovered partially lost source code from APK files in cases where uncommitted changes were no longer accessible. This process involved using tools like JADX and JEB decompilers to restore the code effectively in most scenarios.
